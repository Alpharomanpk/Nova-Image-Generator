# Nova Image Generator

This web application allows users to generate images based on the prompts they provide. It consists of a React.js frontend for user interaction and a Node.js backend that interfaces with OpenAI's DALL-E API. Images generated are stored in a MongoDB database, while the actual images are stored and served using Cloudinary.

## Features

- **Image Generation**: Users can input prompts sent to the backend. The backend processes these prompts using OpenAI's DALL-E API to generate images.
- **Frontend Interface**:
  - **Create Image Page**: Users can input a prompt and generate an image.
  - **Gallery Page**: Displays all previously generated images with their descriptions.
- **Backend Implementation**:
  - **Node.js**: Provides RESTful APIs to communicate between the frontend and OpenAI's DALL-E API.
  - **Integration with OpenAI**: Handles the interaction with OpenAI's DALL-E API to generate images based on user prompts.
  - **Database Integration**: Stores metadata about generated images (such as prompt, image URL) in MongoDB.
  - **Cloudinary Integration**: Stores and serves the images generated by DALL-E.
